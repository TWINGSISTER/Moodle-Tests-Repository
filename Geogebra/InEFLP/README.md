# Multilingual IREM de Marseille and IREM TICE (C2iT) Geogebra Files
In this subfolders you will find multilanguage and report version of Geogebra activities from the 
collection authored by [(InEFLP), IREM de Marseille and IREM TICE (C2iT)](https://www.geogebra.org/m/d4GKJwmq). 
The authors of these Geogebra activities [(see the site here)](https://irem.univ-amu.fr/fr/groupes-travail/groupe-travail-innovation-experimentation-formation-lp) retain the copyright of the
translated versions that, therefore, are distribuited here under the CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 license. These multilingual activities are generate using an automatic translator. [(See this repository)](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator) and try this package [here](https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/index-private-latest.html). You can give a try to each activity by downloading the GGB file to your computer and use the online version of GGB. You can start with [this example](https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/example.html) and then upload another ggb you have downloaded.
## Geogebra Activities for better class cooperation and grade documentation
The IREM repository contains GGB activities that propose several (e.g. 10) exercises. These exercises are automatically generated changing some random variables. The reponses to this set of exercises are analyzed and a grade is automatically generated. This has some drawbacks. First the randomly generated exercises are different across the class. You cannot present an example form your computer and expect student to have the same example on their PC to work on.
Second the original  GGB plugins for Moodle cannot document how the grade is computed. [A JS preprocessor is provided here](https://twingsister.github.io/Moodle-Tests-Repository/Geogebra/InEFLP/index-private-latest-OSA-snap-InEFLP.html) and (in most cases)  this can cut automatically the multi-question exercise to a single question exercise. This processing is supported for a batch of ggb files to be converted.
