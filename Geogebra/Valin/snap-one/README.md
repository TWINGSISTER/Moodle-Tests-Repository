# Moodle Tests Repository OSA with inline solutions snapshots
In this project you will find a collection of activities for Moodle derived from the original Valin activities by imposing a single response in each activity. This integrates better with Moodle reporting system. The student's response is recorded in a GGB image that is pasted to the screen. These activities are generated [with this tool](https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/index-private-latest-OSA-snap.html). In the translation 
folder are collected the multilanguage versions of these activities.
