# Moodle Tests Repository
In this project you will find a collection of activities for Moodle. 
These tests can be used with Moodle installing in your Moodle site the plugin for a modified qtype for Geogebra.

This plugin is contained in  the zip that can be downloaded from 
[this repository](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/moodle-qtype_geogebra/archive/refs/heads/twingsisterdev.zip).

In this repository there are files in different formats.

The files in the mbz format can be restored within any Moodle 4.0 site.

The files with the .ggb extension can be used in any Geogebra question either downloading the .ggb file locally and 
dragging it into the quiz or linking the file from GitHub using the URL of the corresponding ggb file in the GitHub pages.

For instance use the URL  e.g. https://twingsister.github.io/Moodle-Tests-Repository/Geogebra/Valin/1_Multilingual/1_Reperage_plan_693x530-FLEN-FR-IT.ggb to use the ggb in the repository file at "/Geogebra/Valin/1_Multilingual/1_Reperage_plan_693x530-FLEN-FR-IT.ggb"
